Multi-Level Image Thresholding Using Optimization Algorithms

This repository contains MATLAB implementations of various metaheuristic optimization algorithms applied to the multi-level image thresholding problem.

The algorithms included are:

MFO – Moth Flame Optimization

AO – Aquila Optimizer

WOA – Whale Optimization Algorithm

AOA – Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm

Firefly – Firefly Algorithm

GOA – Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm

HGWPSO – Hybrid Grey Wolf with Particle Swarm Optimization

HHO – Harris Hawks Optimization

AVOA – African Vulture Optimization Algorithm

PSO – Particle Swarm Optimization

GWO – Grey Wolf Optimizer

Each MATLAB script demonstrates how the respective algorithm can be used to perform multi-level thresholding on images.

The main script for running the algorithms is MAIN_AWOA.m.
